# Persistent Text Streaming

This is a Convex component for streaming persistent text to the client.
The text is persistent because--in addition to being streamed immediately back
to the original client--it is stored in the database, so it can be accessed by
the client even after the stream has finished, or by other users, etc.

## Usage

Coming soon. See `example/convex` and `example/src/components/*.tsx` for now.

## Background

This is based mainly on the excellent stack article [AI Chat with HTTP Streaming](https://stack.convex.dev/ai-chat-with-http-streaming).
