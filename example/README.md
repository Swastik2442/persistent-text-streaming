# Chat Example App

This is a simple chat app that uses the persistent text streaming component.
When a new prompt is submitted, the app will stream the response from the OpenAI API
back to the client and write the prompt and response to the database in an efficient
way. When the app is refreshed, it will use the database to value to restore the
chat. Other concurrent browser sessions will also see the chat updates by subscribing
to the Convex database records in the usual way.

## Running the app

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- npm (v10+)

### Provisioning the backend and starting the frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # in one terminal
npm run dev:frontend # in another terminal
```

### Establishing your OPENAI_API_KEY

This chat app talks to OpenAI's API. You need to set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable
inside your Convex backend.

1.  Download an API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2.  Run `npx convex env set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>`

Then you should be able to chat successfully with the app. Pop up the Convex dashboard to
debug any issues (the `npx convex dashboard` command will get you to the right place).
